<p>The dining experience in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, combines fresh coastal flavors with a wide variety of restaurant styles. Because the city is located along the Atlantic Ocean, seafood is a major highlight, and many restaurants serve dishes made with locally caught fish and shrimp. For example, Sea Captainâ€™s House is a well-known oceanfront restaurant that has served Southern seafood classics like she-crab soup for decades. Visitors looking for casual options often enjoy places like River City Cafe, famous for its creative burgers and relaxed beach vibe. Myrtle Beach also offers international flavors, such as German dishes at CafÃ© Old Vienna or Italian meals at Ciao. With options ranging from fine dining to laid-back cafes, Myrtle Beach has something for nearly every taste and budget.</p>
