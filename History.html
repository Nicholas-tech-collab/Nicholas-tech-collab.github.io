<h1>The history of Myrtle beachðŸ“–</h1>




<p>Myrtle Beach, named for its native wax myrtle trees, was inhabited by Native Americans, then developed from a timber and turpentine area into the bustling resort town it is today after a contest in 1900 named it and the construction of the Seaside Inn in 1901. It became a city in 1957 and grew rapidly after World War II, becoming a popular family vacation destination known for its beaches, golf, and attractions like the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk and Broadway at the Beach. 
Early History
Native American Inhabitants:
The first inhabitants of the area were the Waccamaw and Winyah tribes, who lived off the land and called it "Chicora," meaning "the land". 
European Settlement:
European settlers arrived in the late 1600s, initially attempting to extend the plantation system, but the sandy soil yielded poor crops. 
The Withers Family:
The Withers family, who arrived in the late 1700s, owned large tracts of land, and the area was once known as Long Bay or Withers. 
Development as a Resort
Timber and Tourism Beginnings:
In the late 1800s, the Burroughs & Collins Company purchased extensive beachfront land for its timber and turpentine business. 
The Name Game:
The area was previously called Long Bay, Withers, or New Town. In 1900, a contest was held to name the community, and "Myrtle Beach" won because of the numerous wax myrtle trees growing along the shore. 
First Hotel:
The Seaside Inn, the area's first hotel, was built by the Burroughs & Collins Company in 1901, marking the beginning of the shift to a resort destination. 
Official Incorporation:
Myrtle Beach was incorporated in 1938 and officially became a city in 1957 when its permanent population exceeded 5,000. 
Mid-20th Century Growth
Post-War Boom:
.
Following World War II, Myrtle Beach experienced rapid growth, becoming a major vacation destination with the arrival of numerous hotels, motels, and family-friendly attractions. 
Military Presence:
.
From the 1940s to the 1990s, Myrtle Beach was also home to a military base, first the U.S. Army Air Corps and later the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, which closed in 1993. The base land was redeveloped into The Market Common, a community with shops, parks, and memorials. 
Broadway at the Beach:
.
The opening of Broadway at the Beach in 1995 expanded entertainment options with its blend of shopping, dining, and entertainment venues. 
Modern Myrtle Beach
Continuing Evolution:
Today, Myrtle Beach is a premier family resort destination with a strong golf culture and a variety of attractions, solidifying its reputation as a lively, family-friendly resort town. 
Cultural Heritage:
The area's history also includes the rich culture of its former plantation system and its designation as an autism-friendly destination in 2018.</p>
